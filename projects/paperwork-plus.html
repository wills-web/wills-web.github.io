          <p class="lead">As part of my involvement in the <a href="https://lcpdfr.com">LCPDFR community</a>, the C# Windows Forms Application, <a href="http://www.lcpdfr.com/files/file/15711-paperworkplus-now-share-your-logs-via-our-online-database/">PaperworkPlus</a> was released in an attempt to hone realism.</p>

          <p>PaperworkPlus was a project that ran in late spring 2017. Using a Windows Forms Application structure and C#, I developed PaperworkPlus, a program that can be used to track statistics collecting during gameplay.</p>

          <p>As the name would suggest, PaperworkPlus acts almost as a paperwork simulator, allowing users to file their records and go back to review them.</p>

          <p>In the first version of PaperworkPlus, users saved their records into XML files, which were then called back for viewing. But, in a later version, users had the option of registering an account and saving their logs to a database, which was shared by all users.</p>

          <p>This allowed community members to log and compare notes, keep track of one anothers progress and so forth.</p>

          <p>Sub-communities, often referred to as clans, had the opportunity to pay for a Community Service, which granted them a private database and control over registering users. This allowed for custom ranks being assigned, custom divisions, custom agency names, etc being associated with the account.</p>

          <p>PaperworkPlus used an array of different technologies, including, but not limited to...</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ul>
                <li>C#</li>
                <li>Windows Forms Application Framework</li>
                <li>XML File Save/Read</li>
                <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <ul>
                  <li>Transact-SQL</li>
                  <li>LINQ</li>
                  <li>Photoshop (for GUI elements)</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

          <p>By far the most useful technology listed was Microsoft Azure. Azure is a cloud-based platform for database solutions, virtual machines, data processing, and so much more. Not having to be concerned with server maintenance was a huge plus to this project, and is likely to be the main factor in assuring its success.</p>

          <p>As this was my first big project, a number of key kills were tested. Firstly, during the development phases, project management was challenging. However through various organisational techniques I was able to manage my workflow properly. Another hurdle during development was that of not having used some of the included technologies before. LINQ, Azure, XML; All components used in PaperworkPlus that I had to learn from scratch, and am now confident in using.</p>

          <p>During the release and feedback stages, handling responses, support requests, and etc was somewhat difficult. However, through instruction, I was able to direct support requests into a "File Comments" section and the feedback into the "File Review" section.</p>

          <p>Overall, <a href="http://www.lcpdfr.com/files/file/15711-paperworkplus-now-share-your-logs-via-our-online-database/">PaperworkPlus</a> was a huge success, boasting over 2000 downloads and over 16,000 views. During production, many lessons have been learned. Ranging from user and feedback management, to better research and development before production.</p>
